# Project Requirements
**_Do not modify this file; it is for your reference only._** 
You should make your edits to README.md while working on your project. 

❗️indicates action items; you should remove these emoji as you 
complete/update the items which they accompany. 
(This means that your final README should have no ❗️in it!)

## ⚡️Project Overview

For your final project, you will be revisiting an earlier piece of code and refactoring it. (In other words, rewriting it to make it better.) In doing so, you must:
1. Implement **at least** one class which is appropriate to your proposed project.
2. Add event handling (mouse or keyboard interaction), either through the
turtle library or using Tkinter.

You can choose from any previous assignment or code from this class, 
including code we gave you as examples (e.g., palindromes), 
code you modified (e.g., DNA), or code you built from scratch 
(e.g., Draw something that makes you smile). You can even combine multiple
assignments together to create something new and interesting!

## 📌Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design
*Due Friday, 11/15, by the **start of class**.*

1. Create your project repository (this one!) 
2. Update the README.md header with your information (name, etc.)
3. Indicate which assignment(s) you plan to use for your project.
4. Copy the original files from those assignments into this repository.
    - Make sure that git is tracking these files (in PyCharm, the filenames should *not* be red; you should also see them on GitHub after pushing)
    - _**Do not modify these files! They are for reference only!**_
5. Create a CRC card for the class you will be implementing:
    - You must include an image of this CRC card in your README.md file.
    - See my example for how to do this.
    - Verify via GitHub that your README.md is formatted appropriately to show your image.
6. **Commit and push** your work!

## 📌Milestone 2: Code
*Due Friday, 11/22, by the **start of class**.*

1. Create and add the new file(s) to your repository for your final project code.
2. Copy and paste any code that you plan to reuse from your reference files into the new file(s). Again, **DO NOT modify your original reference files!**
3. Complete a rough draft of your code! Hints:
    - Refactor your code to use a class(es) first
    - Create stubs for methods that aren't written yet, but you know you'll need
    - *Then*, after that code is fully functional, add event handling
4. **Commit and push** your work often!

## Milestone 3: Virtual Check-in
*Due Friday, 11/29, by 11:55PM*

**NOTE: This is due the Friday after Thanksgiving, when you're on break. Don't forget about it! You can do it before you leave on Wednesday!**

1. Add a note to this section of the README.md that indicates what percentage of the project you have left to complete.

## 📌Milestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo
*Due at the start of your section's Final Exam period.*

1. Final version of your code:
    - Clean up code. Make sure it follows our coding standards.
    - Remove unworking code
    - Comment out (don't delete!) any print statements or other debugging code.
    - Clean up docstrings and comments.  
2. Final, fully completed version of your README.md 
    - Your README should be proofread, nicely formatted, and cleaned up (all sample text/instructions below headings replaced with your own writing)
    - Your README will be graded as it appears on GitHub, so make sure to double check how your formatting looks in a browser (not PyCharm's unformatted version)!
3. In-class lightning presentation (5 minutes, 3 slides)
    - Your slides must be uploaded to your repository as images or a PDF file (not PowerPoint!)
    - You should briefly summarize your response to all of the Milestone 3 README prompts/subheadings
    - You should not have any slides that consist entirely of code, nor should you focus on talking about the details of your code
4. In-class live demo to your classmates
5. **Commit and push** your work before your section's exam period!
